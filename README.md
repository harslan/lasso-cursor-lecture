# ISOM 835: Lasso Regression Meets AI-Powered Development

> **From Theory to Impact: Building Portfolio-Ready Analytics Applications**

This repository contains the lecture materials for ISOM 835: Predictive Analytics at Suffolk University Sawyer Business School, demonstrating how the SAIL framework guides the creation of transformative in-class activities that bridge statistical theory with modern AI-powered development.

## 🎯 Overview

This lecture showcases how students can transform their understanding of Lasso Regression from theoretical knowledge into deployable, portfolio-ready applications. Through hands-on experience with AI-assisted development tools like Cursor, students learn to build interactive Streamlit applications that demonstrate both analytical expertise and professional development capabilities.

## 🌟 The SAIL Framework

This lecture embodies all four pillars of the SAIL framework:

- **S**ocial Intelligence: Collaborating effectively with AI tools and peers
- **A**I Literacy: Developing sophisticated understanding through hands-on application building
- **I**nnovation: Creating novel portfolio artifacts that showcase expertise
- **L**eadership: Producing work that educates and inspires others

## 📚 Learning Objectives
